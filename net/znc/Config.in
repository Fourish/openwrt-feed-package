    ZNC has supported character encodings in core since 1.6.0. If you want to
    look at the earlier "charset" module, it's located at Charset/old. ZNC uses
    UTF-8 internally. You can configure charset used between clients and ZNC,
    and charset used between ZNC and the IRC server. Likely values are UTF-8
    and ISO-8859-1, but you might need other common character encodings.
