# update-ignoreip version 0.2
# Written by J.P. Larocque, <piranha@thoughtcrime.us>, OpenPGP 0x0c14cdda
# This software is in the public domain.
# 
# This script is intended for djbdns users that have applied Russell
# Nelson's patch to circumvent wildcard A records in TLDs:
#
#     http://tinydns.org/djbdns-1.05-ignoreip2.patch
#
# This script will try the wildcard name for each TLD in the
# 'stupid_tlds' variable (eg, '*.com', '*.cx', etc.).  For those
# addresses that resolve, they get added to your dnscache
# 'root/ignoreip' file, and dnscache is restarted.
# 
# Run this script from your dnscache directory.  This script depends
# on a proper PATH.  Old 'root/ignoreips' entries are kept (and dups
# removed), so you can add this program to a cron job to keep ahead
# of new bogus redirection addresses added by Verisign and other TLD
# operators.
# 
# Adding this script to a cron job was its intended purpose, but
# please don't do so without understanding how it works and what could
# happen if it breaks.
# 
# Changelog:
#   version 0.2 (2017/Jul/10)
#       Use official TLDs list where possible
#       Only restart service when files differ
#       Update comments
#   version 0.1 (2003/Sep/17)
#       Initially written and released.
