Description of the main changes (version upgrade, changes to functionality, etc.)

Notify the package maintainer (if not you) about the pull request by including @his_username in this PR explanation. (If necessary, check package commit history to find the maintainer's Github user name)

Remember to verify that commit messages in all commits include the proper "signed-off-by" line.
Preferably use a separate feature branch for the pull request, so that updating/changing the pull request is easy
